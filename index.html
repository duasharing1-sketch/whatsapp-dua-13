This powerful dua calls upon Allah — by His Names Ar-Razzāq (The Provider), Al-Karīm (The Most Generous), and Al-Fattāḥ (The Opener of Doors) — to grant you expansive provision, success in your work and finances, and divine support in every effort.

Because when Allah opens a door, no one can close it.

“If you put your trust in Allah as you should, He will provide for you as He provides for the birds. They leave in the morning with empty stomachs and return full.” — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (Tirmidhi)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Razzaq (O Provider), Ya Kareem (O Most Generous), Ya Fattah (O Opener of Doors), open wide the doors of Your infinite bounty and generosity for us. Grant us immense success in all our monetary, wealth, and business endeavors, and bless every aspect of our financial affairs. Ya Badi’ul Samawati wal Ard (O Originator of the heavens and the earth), orchestrate for us Your divine guidance and support in all our tasks, making the path to our goals smooth and effortlessly attainable. Envelop us in such of Your mercy that we no longer stand in need of the mercies of others, and that our reliance remains solely upon Your boundless grace and favor.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said:
